# Train Crawler Tool
[中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)


A train ticket crawler built with Python (backend) and TypeScript + React (frontend), designed to fetch and display CR (China Railway) train ticket information.

## 📌 Overview

Train Crawler Tool is a full-stack application that:

- Crawls train ticket data from CR-related sources

- Processes and structures ticket information on the backend

- Provides a web-based frontend for visualization and interaction

The project separates concerns clearly between data acquisition (Python) and user interaction (React), making it suitable for extension, analysis, or integration into other systems.
